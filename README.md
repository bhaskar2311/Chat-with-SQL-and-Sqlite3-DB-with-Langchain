# Chat-with-SQL-and-Sqlite3-DB-with-Langchain

In this project, I am connecting my Langchain with Groq API Key to both the SQLLite3 and MySQL Database.

For the SQLite3, you will just need to give the Groq API Key.
For MySQL, you will need more information, like host, user, password, etc.

Then you can interact with the database easily.
